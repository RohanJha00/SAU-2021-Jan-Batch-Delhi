                          It's a brighter start to Day 3 in Brisbane after all the thunderstorms
                         and wet outfield last evening. Still overcast but we'll take that. A lot 
                         rests on Ajinkya Rahane and Cheteshwar Pujara, including which way the Border-Gavaskar 
                         Trophy might go, so sit in tight on your couch this morning and enjoy our coverage. 
                         Usually a lot happens on this day in Test cricket, especially when there's a crack running 
                         through the good length area.

                          David Moyes was impressed by the performance of fit-again Michail Antonio 
                          as he fired West Ham to a 1-0 victory over Burnley on Saturday, and may not 
                          pursue a new striker as a result.

                          James Harden addressed the media Friday for the first time since joining the 
                          Brooklyn Nets in Wednesday’s blockbuster trade and countered the narrative he 
                          was disrespectful to former teammates, while explaining his rationale for 
                          wanting to depart the Houston Rockets.

                          Harden expressed remorse for the way things played out in his last days in 
                          Houston, but explained that he took a hard look at the organization, and “felt 
                          like we didn’t have a chance” after it fell in the playoffs last season to the 
                          Lakers in just five games.
